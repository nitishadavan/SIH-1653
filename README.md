## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
AI-Powered Virtual Interview Platform:
Develop an AI-driven virtual interview platform that simulates a real-life boardroom experience. The platform should include features like video conferencing, real-time transcription, and sentiment analysis to assess candidate responses. It should also provide a structured flow, starting with ice-breaking questions and progressing to in-depth techno-managerial questions based on the candidate's expertise and level.

Dynamic Question Bank with Relevance Scoring:
Create a dynamic question bank tailored to the specific expertise and level of the candidate. The system should automatically generate questions relevant to the candidate's area of specialization and assign a relevance score to each question. This ensures that the questions align with the advertised post's requirements and the candidate's background.

Real-Time Response Evaluation and Grading:
Implement an AI-based evaluation system that grades candidate responses in real-time. The system should assess the relevance, depth, and accuracy of the responses with respect to the questions asked. It should provide quantifiable scores for each response, helping experts objectively evaluate the candidate's subject knowledge and suitability for the role.

Bias Detection and Mitigation Tools:
Integrate bias detection algorithms into the platform to ensure an unbiased and objective interview process. The system should flag any potential biases in questions or evaluations, ensuring fairness and consistency across all candidates. This will enhance the credibility of the recruitment process.

Comprehensive Performance Dashboard:
Provide a dashboard for both candidates and experts that displays detailed performance metrics, including relevance scores for questions and responses, overall subject knowledge scores, and suitability ratings for the advertised post. This dashboard will help experts make informed decisions and provide candidates with constructive feedback for improvement.
